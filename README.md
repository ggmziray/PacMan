# PacMan
Name: PacMan MIT Exercise 

Description: Coursework activity using a PacMan image to simulate the PacMan moving across the screen and reversing direction. We didn't attempt to build the full PacMan game in this activity. However, we built a feature of this game, which displays and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other.

Installation: All the code and starter files are availble for use.

Usage: Feel free to enjoy using this directional movement feature. 

Support: If you need some help, email me at gg@F-99.org and I'll be happy to help.

Roadmap: No future fixes or improvements planed for this project.
